To run the example, you can simply execute mkv_to_mp4.bat or mkv2mp4.exe which are in the root folder.

When it asks to input a file or folder, you can read the instructions, and type the relative path of the videos : ```example```

These 3 videos are some snippets of the same video. They are 30 seconds and contain the same streams.

Then, select streams `3` then `1`  (for japanese audio and french subtitles) and you'll have the mp4 file created.
